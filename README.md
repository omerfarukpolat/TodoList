## Development Stages
To set up the development environment for this application, you need to create a .env file that will hold your environment variables. You can use the provided .env.example file as a template to create your own .env file.

To create a user, simply navigate to the Login Page and click on the "Sign Up" button. Fill in the required fields such as your username, email, and password. Once you've created an account, you can proceed to log in to the application.

The application utilizes Mongoose as the database for managing users and todos. User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are generated to authenticate and authorize users.

In the database, there are 2 collections named "users" and "items". "Users" collection holds
registered users' information and "items" collection holds the todos of the users.

To establish a connection to your Mongoose Cluster, you need to provide the Mongoose Cluster URL by setting the MONGO_URL variable in the .env file. If you don't have an account, please feel free to contact me or create one.
